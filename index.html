                   Racism and bias. It's a global issue, 
                    but over the summer there is a movement that is on the rise demanding police reform and justice for African American communities. 
                    Racism and police brutality aren't only present in the US, but the police force in the US does have a racist start.   
                    So many African Americans today have an uneasy and frankly bad relationship with the police. This isn't consequential, 
                    police for decades have been using their authority to control and alter the lives of so many colored people. 
                    In the US there is a huge interconnected web of police brutality, the mass incarceration system, poverty, and race. 
                    Almost every single year there are protests, they have been happening all throughout the two thousands, 
                    but politicians seem to ignore the public's pleas for reform and change. Almost for a decade, year in and year out, 
                    we've been watching African Americans die in the hands of law enforcement. 
                    This summer due to the murder of George Floyd there have been riots and protests not only in the United States but also globally.

                    The thing police have never been courageous, brave or on the side of justice for african americans. 
                    The constitution states that everyone is granted freedom and justice but in actuality how much of that is true for people of color?
                    So when did this happen this fear of the police
